# Saefty-Stock Web App
Progressive web app with React JS.

This is part of my last year's project of secondary school, which comes along with Saefty-Stock Access control

All toghether, it aims to control the stock of a storeroom from school, incorporating RFID tags to access, barcodes to identify supplies and tools and a progressive web app to visualize who has taken what, which supplies have to be bought and which tools are being used.
